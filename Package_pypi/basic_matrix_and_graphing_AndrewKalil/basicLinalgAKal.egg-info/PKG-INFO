Description: ## Basic Linear Algebra
        This package performs basic linear algebra operations and matrix manipulations
        
        ### Intallation
        In your command line or command prompnt, you can install the package using the following command:
        ```
        pip install basicLinalgAKO
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        Once the package is installed locally, open up a python script file (name it whatever you want) and test it out with the following:
        
        ##### 1) For operations between two matrices
        ```
        import basicLinalgAKO as BLA
        
        matrix1 = [[1, 3, 5],[2, 4, 6]]
        matrix2 = [[7, 9, 11],[8, 10, 12]]
        
        operations = BLA(matrix1, matrix2)
        print("addition: \n", operations.addition(), "\n")
        print("substraction: \n", operations.substraction(), "\n")
        print("multiplication: \n", operations.multiplication(), "\n")
        print("division: \n", operations.division(), "\n")
        print("dot product: \n", operations.dot(), "\n")
        ```
        ##### Output:
        
        ##### 2) For matrix manipulations
        ```
        import basicLinalgAKO as BLA
        
        matrix1 = [[1, 3, 5],[2, 4, 6]]
        
        manipulations = BLA(matrix1)
        print("array transpose: \n", manipulations.transpose(), "\n")
        print("array determinant: \n", manipulations.determinant(), "\n")
        print("array invertion: \n", manipulations.invertion(), "\n")
        print("array scalar: \n", manipulations.scalar(5), "\n")
        print("array matrix shape: \n", manipulations.matrix_shape(), "\n")
        print("array matrix: \n", manipulations.show_matrix(), "\n")
        ```
        ##### Output:
